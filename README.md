This tool is not a professional program and only
utilizes the most basic forms of nmap, and is, at this point,
a proof of concept and streamlines the enumeration process. 
There are most certainly better programs that do the same 
thing and offer more features than this program, even with 
better evasion tactics.

This program is open source, does not collect any data, 
IP Addresses or information, and you may make changes
to this program at your leisure.

I kindly ask that you do not use this program maliciously
I am not responsible for consequences following 
exploitations, if any, uncovered by this program.
